works in both fullscreen and windowed mode, thanks to image recognition.

Without .venv:

1. make sure you have python 3.x installed
2. install these libraries (python -m pip install)
  pyautogui
  Pillow
  opencv-python
3. open main.py in a text editor or IDE, and change 'iterations = 86' to however many tokens you have.
4. open LoR, and navigate to the expeditions screen. make sure you haven't started one already.
5. run the program. don't use you mouse while it runs. (python main.py)
